# Skyscanner Project:

The current thesis was part of the Skyscanner project:
https://www.laas.fr/projects/skyscanner/

It is a joint venture of five research instititions in Toulouse that aims at
the study and experimentation of a fleet of mini-drones that cooperates to enable the
adaptive sampling of cumulus-type clouds. The goal is to analyze the cloud's behaviour over the
timespan of an hour, which corresponds to the expected lifetime of a cloud.
